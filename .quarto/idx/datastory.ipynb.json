The rise of agriculture and the industrial era has, however, changed things, turning us into bare sedentary animals... until now! \n\n![](images/heComputer.gif)\n\n[Wikispeedia](https://dlab.epfl.ch/wikispeedia/play/) is an easy and fun game: You are given two Wikipedia articles, and starting from the first article, your goal is to reach the second one exclusively by following links in the articles you encounter, effectively letting you explore your own paths across the vast wikipedia, for free! Your game data is collected by [The EPFL Data Science Lab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/), which helps us and them better understand some aspects of human behaviour üòâ.\n\nUsing this data, we ask ourselves, are there patterns in the way players navigate the network, that make them more successful? That is, are there any optimal strategy that doesn't require extensive knowledge of the network?\n\nPlayers are faced with multiple stimulae during the playing session, and players' decisions as well as their posterior success may be influenced by them. For example, users might navigate the network through `semantic similarity` optimization, or they might just click the links found in `images` or `tables`, etc.\n\nDo these particular features have any effect on players' success? Let's see!\n\nWhatever\n---\n\n## A look into the collected data...\n\n\n\n# Players as humans \n### Strategies and attitudes\n\nBeing the Wikispeedia game and **individual** and **timed game**, players responses to the challenge it serves are miscellaneous. \nIndividuals may **consciously** come up with a **strategy** to tackle the task they are assigned to, or **unintentionally** manifest a **behavior** that could be observed by scrupulous data analysts, like us. \nThe Wikispeedia game itself was designed to extrapolate information allowing the computation of semantic distance between real-world concepts, to be leveraged in intelligent applications. \nLess ambitiously, we‚Äôre interest in outlining players mutual attitudes and the likeliness these **lead** them to **succeed in the game**, potentially a causal relationship. \nAmong the manifold performable strategies we hypothesised the following:\n- clicking on hyperlinks showing up at the **top** of the article page;\n- clicking on hyperlinks showing up in **image captions**;\n- clicking hyperlinks that are **semantically related** to the previously clicked;  \n- clicking hyperlinks that are semantically related to the **target article**. \n\n_Look at the webpage below, isn‚Äôt your gaze naturally directed towards those velvet red petals?_\nThis is what we‚Äôre talking about. \n\n![](images/Aesthetics.png)\n\nAs ‚Äúthe Parthenon's facade‚Äù showing a marvellous  ‚Äúinterpretation of golden rectangles in its proportions‚Äù is judged to be aesthetically valuable by humans ability to discriminate at a sensory level, it is also true that **visual content attracts human attention** more than raw text. \n\nAdditionally, picture yourself in a **competitive framework**, with a stopwatch in your left hand and your right trembling fingers on a mouse, determined to break down the shortest ever recorded Wikispeedia game and be remembered for eternity. \nWouldn‚Äôt you click on **top-positioned hyperlinks** or would you parse the article in search for the best catch?\n\n![](images/stressed.png)\nhttps://www.dreamstime.com/failed-stressed-businessman-tired-to-work-computer-put-hands-head-busy-time-hard-working-cartoon-background-image163719368\n\n\nIn deed, this is the case, at least for the majority of participants to the game. \n\nThe graphs can be read as follows: the heights of the columns represent a measure of how trendy the target behavior is among players; the left-sided column, per behavior, is the distribution among unsuccessful players, while the right-sided is the one among successful players. \n\nIt is evident that clicking hyperlinks showing up in **image captions** is a **trendy behavior** for Wikispeedia players, especially among the **successful**. The rate of successful players clicking on images‚Äô captions is roughly 4 times the unsuccessful players one.\n\nIt is evident that clicking on hyperlinks showing up at the **top of an article** is largely trendier than clicking on hyperlinks elsewhere positioned in the article text (4 to 5 times more common). The gap between successful and unsuccesful players is not that large to show a pattern. It'll be interesting to test! \n\nNext, a little trickier to understand: **semantic similarity**. Semantic similarity is a metric that evaluates the distance between items on the basis of the **likeness of their meaning** or semantic content. Humans at play, challenged to reach a target article, whereof the only information they‚Äôre provided with is a word or phrase, display common sense knowledge. They would, in fact, look for semantic **relatedness** in clicking the hyperlinks.\nThinking of the **hypertextual Wikipedia graph** alone, it can be viewed as a primitive semantic **network**: articles represent the concepts and the hyperlinks are the means of connection between them.\nTwo articles can be more or less \"semantically related\" if, naivly, the two \"overlap\" well, with regard to the words present in them and the way they are ordered or used in context. \n\nAn illustration of the structure of the Wikispeedia hypertextual graph is shown in the image below (a part of it). The path between the source article \"mathematics\" to the target article \"Alan Touring\" is represented. The grey arrows connect nodes (i.e. hyperlinks) of a human path with length equal to 3, while the black arrows connect nodes of the shortest existing path between source and target articles, with length 2. \n\nAn attitude it is reasonable to suppose players would perform is to click on hyperlinks that are semantically closer and closer, along the human path, to the target article (see yellow arrows in the graph below). \nA finer one is to click on articles linked by increasing similarity between two neighbouring along the path (see green arrows in the graph below). \n: the tone of the color is matched with \"intensity/degree of the similarity\"\n\n\n## JEFF's PLOTS\n\n# Methods\n\n### Matching \n\nThe methodology chosen for the data processing step is to perform a **matched analysis** with the final objective to test if specific **players' game strategies lead to success** in the Wikispeedia game. To this end a **logistic regression** is conducted with **players' success as the outcome** and the following **strategies as predictors**:\n1. Positioning of the clicked hyperlinks;\n2. Clicking hyperlinks in image captions;\n3. Clicking articles with the following semantic similarity patterns:\n   - increasing semantic similarity along the path between articles and the target article;\n   - increasing semantic similarity along the path between two sequentially clicked articles.\n\nSeveral **confounders** may affect the outcome of the regression analysis i.e. of the potential correlation between the aforementioned features and success.\nTo mention a few, the **‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù** of the randomly assigned task (source and target articles), affects the players' successfulness together with the strategy adopted to address it. This ‚Äúdifficulty‚Äù could be naively measured by **shortest path distance** between the source and target article in the Wikispeedia hyperlinks graph (calculated with the Floyd-Warshall algorithm).\nAdditionally, the **characteristics** (e.g. nodes in- and out-degree, path legth) of the **\"human path\"** (i.e. the actual sequence of clicked hyperlinks by the player), again reasonably affects players successfulness and their choice for a strategy.\n\n### Andres, comment curvature features\n\nIn order to remove the aforementioned confounders, the dataset is filtered and the matching is performed accordingly with the assumptions made. Players are matched on same shortest path distance of the assigned task, and maximum **propensity score**, with the **treated subject** being the user performing a specific strategy (e.g. clicking more frequently than the average on hyperlinks showing up in images‚Äô captions) and the **controlled subject** being the user NOT performing the strategy.\n\nThe analysis challenge can be reformulated as follows: _**‚Äúbeing assigned an equally difficult task and being equally free to perform a specific strategy, are players more successful if they adopt that specific strategy?‚Äù**_\n\n#### Calculation of propensity score\n\nThe purpose motivating the matched analysis is to obtain a \"balanced\" testing dataset, with subjects actually comparable. In fact, we want to test potential correlation (causation ?) between specific strategies performed and players' success. The players tested should then be at the **same starting point** when choosing what strategy to adopt, i.e. have same probability to get the treatment (a.k.a. propensity score).\nThe propensity scores are obtained by calculating the **predicted outcomes of a logistic regression** with the outcome being the _probability of treatment_ and the predictors being _features of the human paths_.\nThe **treated subject** is the _user performing the specific strategy_, the **controlled subjct** is the user _NOT performing the specific startegy_.\n\n### Logistic regression\n**Finally, let's test if there's a programmatic way to win this game!!** <br>\nA logistic regression analysis is conducted with the outcome being players' success in the game and the predictors being the strategies performed by the players. \n\n\nHow are the data distributed among successful and unsuccessful games? The following plots show \n\n1. The distributions of optimal lengths of the proposed games.\n2. The distributions of path lengths obtained by humans.\n\n\n\n\nGiven a shortest path length of 3, the majority of human path lengths are 3, 4, 5 for both successful and unsuccessful paths. Let's filter the corresponding DataFrames to only keep these path lengths. The matched analysis will be done with these lengths.\n\n---\n\n## And now the real deal\n\nWe wanna test wheather different strategies lead to success in the Wikispeedia game. With this goal in mind, paths can be characterized through local features of the clicked links and articles. The features we extract are:\n\n- Relative position of each hyperlink within the current article.\n- Is the hyperlink next to an image?\n- Is the hyperlink inside a table?\n- Similarity between current and target article.\n- Hyperlink curvature along the path.\n\nOnce each path has been featurized we perform a matching analysis that lets us reduce the bias in the distributions of successful and unsuccessful populations. For this, we find pairs of `subjects` (paths) in the dataset, that have very similar features, but differ in the one we want to test (the `treatment`). The new distributions will then be much less biased and we will be able to compare the effect of the treatment variable. \n\n### Confounding variables\n\nMany factors can affect the analysis, among them:\n\n1. the difficulty of each task, and \n2. the strategy adopted to solve it. \n\nTo address the first, we naively quantify `difficulty` of a task as the minimum distance between the source and the target, as determined with the Floyed-Warshall algorithm, while the second is addressed through path length, e.g. the total number of links clicked by each player in the given game.\n\nControlling by such variables allows a first approximation to controlling these confounding effects.\n\n### Treatment\n\nWe will test the effect of clicking mostly links in image boxes.\n\nThe question is then: given an equally difficult task assigned, and having a fixed number of possible choices to perform, are players more successful if they adopt `clicking mainly links in images` as a strategy?\n\n\n\nAt this point, we have filtered the successful and unsuccessful DataFrames by the following conditions:\n\n    Shortest path length = 3 --> we hypothesize that all paths have the same \"difficulty\" by enforcing this\n    The actual human path lengths are 3,4,5 --> the majority of human paths are within these lengths\n\nThe next step is to perform matching of datasets. To make this process possible, we first augment both successful and unsuccessful DataFrames with is_successful Boolean condition.\n\n\n\n2 . Document Similarity\nSimilarity Between Wikipedia Articles: 'Bag-of-Words' Cosine Similarity Based on Word Frequencies\n\nWe are interested in measuring *similarity* between Wikipedia articles to investigate players' strategies in Wikispeedia. The proposed similarity is Cosine Similarity measured on word frequencies given a pair of articles. Therefore, the assumption we make is that articles with similar occurrences of words are similar.\n\nIn order to mitigate similarity due to common English words such as \"the\", we apply a filter as follows:\n\n    Remove all Stop words as defined in Scikit-learn\n\n    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#nqy18\n\n    Remove all white spaces and \\n characters\n\n    Apply a scaled version of word frequency count as implemented in TfidfTransformer in Scikit-learn:\n\n    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer\n\nThe cell blocks below show our data processing pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nThe syntax in the above table is interpreted as :\n\n    Sequential means the strictly increasing Cosine similarity was measured for sequential articles\n    Target means the strictly increasing Cosine similarity was measured based on sequential article compared to the target article\n    The number indicates the human path length fixed. Previously, we also fixed that the shortest path length is 3.\n\nOur research question is:\n\n*When given X number of choices in the same difficulty game, how did successful and unsuccessful players differ in their clicking behaviour?*\n\nBased on the above table, the p-values for both the incercept and coefficient for logistic regression are significant for all experiments except 1 (Sequential 5). The interpretation for all experiment findings are similar. Concretely, consider the experiment Sequential 3. The interpretation is:\n\n    *Given a shortest path length of 3 (fixed difficulty) and given a human path length of 3 (when the human makes 3 choices on article clicks), clicking articles with increasing Cosine similarity between sequential articles (as a proxy to measure semantic meaning), leads to more successful outcomes.*\n\nFor Target experiments have a similar interpretation. Concretely, consider the experiment Target 5:\n\n    *Given a shortest path length of 3 (fixed difficulty) and given a human path length of 5 (when the human makes 5 choices on article clicks), clicking articles with increasing Cosine similarity between the current article and the target article (as a proxy to measure semantic meaning), leads to more successful outcomes.*\n\nThese findings are interesting and suggest that (potentially contrarily to common sense) clicking articles based on semantic meaning can lead to more successful outcomes in the Wikispeedia game (at least the current version we are investigating).\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"datastory.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"pulse","title":"Wikispeedia: An exploration into human strategy through path navigation.","jupyter":"python3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
