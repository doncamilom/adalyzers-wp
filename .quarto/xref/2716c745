Of course, on the diagonal, the similarties are all 1 as an article’s similarity to itself should be identical. The interesting values are around “Cygni” articles and time periods. “Cygni” are star systems/extrasolar planets so similarity in their corresponding Wikipedia articles should be expected. Similarly, time periods should also have some similarity, in agreement with the heatmap.","key":"fig-wp-example","order":{"number":6,"section":[1,1,1,3,0,0,0]}},{"caption":"Curvature describes the context of the links that are clicked, within the network.
