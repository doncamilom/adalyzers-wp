    "text": "Wikispeedia: What the hell is this?\nSince the earliest records, humans have wandered across endless lands and walked thorugh mysterious paths, in an attempt to uncover the unexplored and find better conditions for their tribes. The rise of agriculture and the industrial era has, however, changed things, turning us into bare sedentary animals… until now!\n\nWikispeedia is an easy and fun game: You are given two Wikipedia articles, and starting from the first article, your goal is to reach the second one exclusively by following links in the articles you encounter, effectively letting you explore your own paths across the vast wikipedia, for free! Your game data is collected by The EPFL Data Science Lab, which helps us and them better understand some aspects of human behaviour 😉.\nUsing this data, we ask ourselves, are there patterns in the way players navigate the network, that make them more successful? That is, are there any optimal strategy that doesn’t require extensive knowledge of the network?\nPlayers are faced with multiple stimulae during the playing session, and players’ decisions as well as their posterior success may be influenced by them. For example, users might navigate the network through semantic similarity optimization, or they might just click the links found in images or tables, etc.\nDo these particular features have any effect on players’ success? Let’s see!\nWhatever"

    "text": "And now the real deal\nWe wanna test wheather different strategies lead to success in the Wikispeedia game. With this goal in mind, paths can be characterized through local features of the clicked links and articles. The features we extract are:\n\nRelative position of each hyperlink within the current article.\nIs the hyperlink next to an image?\nIs the hyperlink inside a table?\nSimilarity between current and target article.\nHyperlink curvature along the path.\n\nOnce each path has been featurized we perform a matching analysis that lets us reduce the bias in the distributions of successful and unsuccessful populations. For this, we find pairs of subjects (paths) in the dataset, that have very similar features, but differ in the one we want to test (the treatment). The new distributions will then be much less biased and we will be able to compare the effect of the treatment variable.\n\nConfounding variables\nMany factors can affect the analysis, among them:\n\nthe difficulty of each task, and\nthe strategy adopted to solve it.\n\nTo address the first, we naively quantify difficulty of a task as the minimum distance between the source and the target, as determined with the Floyed-Warshall algorithm, while the second is addressed through path length, e.g. the total number of links clicked by each player in the given game.\nControlling by such variables allows a first approximation to controlling these confounding effects.\n\n\nTreatment\nWe will test the effect of clicking mostly links in image boxes.\nThe question is then: given an equally difficult task assigned, and having a fixed number of possible choices to perform, are players more successful if they adopt clicking mainly links in images as a strategy?\n\n\nCode\n\nsuccessful_df = successful_df[(successful_df['shortest_path_length'].apply(lambda x: x == 3))]\nsuccessful_df = successful_df[(successful_df['human_path_length'].apply(lambda x: 3 <= x <= 5))]\nsuccessful_df.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nunsuccessful_df = unsuccessful_df[(unsuccessful_df['shortest_path_length'].apply(lambda x: x == 3))]\nunsuccessful_df = unsuccessful_df[(unsuccessful_df['human_path_length'].apply(lambda x: 3 <= x <= 5))]\nunsuccessful_df.head(3)\n\n\nAt this point, we have filtered the successful and unsuccessful DataFrames by the following conditions:\nShortest path length = 3 --> we hypothesize that all paths have the same \"difficulty\" by enforcing this\nThe actual human path lengths are 3,4,5 --> the majority of human paths are within these lengths\nThe next step is to perform matching of datasets. To make this process possible, we first augment both successful and unsuccessful DataFrames with is_successful Boolean condition.\n\n\nCode\n\n\nsuccessful_df['is_successful'] = 1\nunsuccessful_df['is_successful'] = 0\n\n# merge the successful and unsuccessful DataFrames\nfinal_df = pd.concat([successful_df, unsuccessful_df])\nfinal_df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n\nfinal_df.head(3)\n\n# save the DataFrame\nfinal_df.to_csv('final_df.csv')\n\n# next, we will calculate \"treatments\" involving semantic distance metrics for the DataFrame\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n2 . Document Similarity Similarity Between Wikipedia Articles: ‘Bag-of-Words’ Cosine Similarity Based on Word Frequencies\nWe are interested in measuring similarity between Wikipedia articles to investigate players’ strategies in Wikispeedia. The proposed similarity is Cosine Similarity measured on word frequencies given a pair of articles. Therefore, the assumption we make is that articles with similar occurrences of words are similar.\nIn order to mitigate similarity due to common English words such as “the”, we apply a filter as follows:\nRemove all Stop words as defined in Scikit-learn\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#nqy18\n\nRemove all white spaces and \\n characters\n\nApply a scaled version of word frequency count as implemented in TfidfTransformer in Scikit-learn:\n\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfTransformer\nThe cell blocks below show our data processing pipeline.\n\n\nCode\n\n\nimport os\n\nbase_path = '.data/plaintext_articles'\narticles = os.listdir(base_path)\n# sort the article names in alphabetical order.

Previously, we also fixed that the shortest path length is 3.\nOur research question is:\nWhen given X number of choices in the same difficulty game, how did successful and unsuccessful players differ in their clicking behaviour?\nBased on the above table, the p-values for both the incercept and coefficient for logistic regression are significant for all experiments except 1 (Sequential 5). The interpretation for all experiment findings are similar. Concretely, consider the experiment Sequential 3. The interpretation is:\n*Given a shortest path length of 3 (fixed difficulty) and given a human path length of 3 (when the human makes 3 choices on article clicks), clicking articles with increasing Cosine similarity between sequential articles (as a proxy to measure semantic meaning), leads to more successful outcomes.*\nFor Target experiments have a similar interpretation. Concretely, consider the experiment Target 5:\n*Given a shortest path length of 3 (fixed difficulty) and given a human path length of 5 (when the human makes 5 choices on article clicks), clicking articles with increasing Cosine similarity between the current article and the target article (as a proxy to measure semantic meaning), leads to more successful outcomes.*\nThese findings are interesting and suggest that (potentially contrarily to common sense) clicking articles based on semantic meaning can lead to more successful outcomes in the Wikispeedia game (at least the current version we are investigating).\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\nFigure 1: ?(caption)"

    "text": "Wikispeedia: What does X have to do with Y? You better find out!\nSince the earliest records, humans have wandered across endless lands and walked thorugh mysterious paths, in an attempt to uncover the unexplored and find better conditions for their tribes. The rise of agriculture and the industrial era has, however, changed things, turning us into bare sedentary animals… until now!\n\nWikispeedia is an easy and fun game: You are given two Wikipedia articles, and starting from the first article, your goal is to reach the second one exclusively by following links in the articles you encounter, effectively letting you explore your own paths across the vast wikipedia, for free! Your game data is collected by The EPFL Data Science Lab, which helps us and them better understand some aspects of human behaviour 😉.\nUsing this data, we ask ourselves, are there patterns in the way players navigate the network, that make them more successful? That is, are there any optimal strategy that doesn’t require extensive knowledge of the network?\nPlayers are faced with multiple stimulae during the playing session, and players’ decisions as well as their posterior success may be influenced by them. For example, users might navigate the network through semantic similarity optimization, or they might just click the links found in images or tables, etc.\nDo these particular features have any effect on players’ success? Let’s find out!"
