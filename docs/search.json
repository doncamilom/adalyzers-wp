    "text": "Wikispeedia: What the hell is this?\nWikispeedia is an easy and fun game: You are given two Wikipedia articles, and starting from the first article, your goal is to reach the second one exclusively by following links in the articles you encounter. This game was created by The EPFL Data Science Lab to gather data.\nUsing this data, we ask ourselves, are there patterns in the way players navigate the network, that make them more successful? That is, are there any optimal strategy that doesn’t require extensive knowledge of the network?\nPlayers are faced with multiple stimulae during the playing session, and players’ decisions as well as their posterior success may be influenced by them. For example, users might navigate the network through semantic similarity optimization, or they might just click the links found in images or tables, etc.\nDo these particular features have any effect on players’ success? Let’s see!"
